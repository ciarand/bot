What does it do?
----------------
Nothing right now.

What will it do?
----------------
Lots of cool stuff!

Getting started
---------------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bot requires a certain amount of basic configuration.

Specifically it needs the connection:

- Username (XMPP, not your regular HipChat username)

- Room ID (or "all" if that's your thing)

- Full name (needs to be lowercase and *exactly* match your HipChat account settings)

- Mention name

[NOTE]
The mention name doesn't have to match what HipChat thinks it is. But, since the
client provides mention-completion, it's probably a good idea.

Using environmental variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can configure the bot via environment variables. They look like this:

----
HIPCHAT_USERNAME
HIPCHAT_ROOM_ID
HIPCHAT_FULL_NAME
HIPCHAT_MENTION_NAME
----

Using a .conf file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To help you in making the configuration easier the bot parses and interprets
a `.conf` file that looks like a very simple shell env file:

----
HIPCHAT_USERNAME=00000_0000000
HIPCHAT_ROOM_ID=00000_my_cool_room@conf.hipchat.com
HIPCHAT_FULL_NAME=mr roboto
HIPCHAT_MENTION_NAME=roboto
----

Using command line params
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also specify these via command line parameters. Something like this
should work:

----
bot -username 00000_0000000 \
    -room 00000_my_cool_room@conf.hipchat.com \
    -full_name "mr roboto" \
    -mention_name "roboto"
----
